Hi there!

I'm still figuring things out when it comes to system setups, automation, and self-hosting. In my free time, I like to experiment with Proxmox, Docker, and various Linux setups. Most of what I share here comes from hands-on tinkering. It might not always be the most practical, but it's been a great learning experience.
